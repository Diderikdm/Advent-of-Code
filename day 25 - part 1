Analyzing...

Doors here lead:

A loud, robotic voice says "Analysis complete! You may proceed." and you enter the cockpit.
Santa notices your small droid, looks puzzled for a moment, realizes what has happened, and radios your ship directly.
"Oh, hello! You should be able to get in by typing 805307408 on the keypad at the main airlock."
