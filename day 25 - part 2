I want to thank Eric Wastl (maker of AoC) for all the impressively challenging puzzles. This year was my first year doing the AoC and
this was the first time I challenged myself as an aspiring programmer. When I started the AoC at the start of December, I had basically
zero prior knowledge of programming, syntax and Python in particular. Attempting the puzzles each day led me to improve so much in so 
little time, as every puzzle required somewhat of a different approach. I learned about generators, lists, lists in lists dictionaries 
and manipulating data. Resulting from these challenges and the skills I obtained from doing the puzzles, I was able to get my PCEP- and 
PCAP-certificates inPython programming, and led to convince me I want a future in programming.

Thank you!
